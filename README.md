# [Travel Insurance Prediction App]([url](https://travel-insurance-prediction-anzal.streamlit.app/)) (Capstone Project)
https://travel-insurance-prediction-anzal.streamlit.app/

## Overview
This project is centered around a web-based application that evaluates the likelihood of a user purchasing travel insurance. The application leverages a RandomForestClassifier, a machine learning algorithm, to analyze user inputs and predict outcomes. Developed with Streamlit, this tool offers an engaging and interactive way to assess insurance needs.

## Features
- A user-friendly sidebar for gathering input parameters.
- Visual comparisons of user metrics with standard parameters using radar charts.
- A feature importance graph to showcase key factors influencing the prediction.
- A resource section with helpful information and links.
- A stylish UI with gradient backgrounds and subtle animations.

## How It Works
Participants input their data, such as age, employment type, chronic disease status, and other relevant health and lifestyle information. After submitting their data, the application processes it through a pretrained machine learning model to evaluate the propensity to opt for travel insurance. The app presents results using engaging animations and allows users to download a summary PDF report for additional convenience and analysis.

## Resources Section
In the 'Information & Resources' area of the app, users can find additional material and external links concerning travel insurance options and the importance of being insured while traveling.
